    <h2>DIY Recycled Paper Decorations</h2>
    <img src="images/paper_decorations.jpg" height="500px" width="500px">

    <p>In the past few years I’ve really noticed how much packaging
         comes with Christmas. Yes, gifts often come with excess 
         decorative packaging. Plastic to hold things in place and 
         never ending instruction manuals no one actually ever reads.
          But besides that. Food comes with more packaging. Buying gifts 
          online comes with more packaging. My recycling bin is overflowing 
          and we’re weeks off the big day yet! With this in mind I’m
           always trying to find ways to use up the excess. I want to make 
           things that will actually lower waste during this season. 
           Decorations and even gifts can be made from your left over 
           packaging. You don’t believe me? Scroll down below to know more.</p>

    <p>I made these stars from offcuts of parcel paper, but you can 
        make them with used wrapping paper for a fun activity on 
        Christmas day, packaging paper, newspaper etc. It’s easy and
         looks awesome! I added string and used them as decorations 
         but they’d look amazing as a garland or on a wreath.</p>

    <pre>Materials

        - Recycled paper
        - Scissors
        - Glue stick
        - Thread</pre>

    <p>Step 1</p>
    <img src="images/paper_decorations_1.jpg" height="500px" width="500px">
    <p>Cut a strip of paper with a width around the size you’d like
         the decoration to be. Make the length 2 -3 times as long. 
         At one end fold over a strip around 2 cm wide. Turn the paper
          and fold again creating a concertina effect.</p>

    <p>Step 2</p>
    <img src="images/paper_decorations_2.jpg" height="500px" width="500px">
    <p> Fold the paper in half and cut the unfolded edge to a point 
        (straight or curved). Then cut notches out from either side.</p>

    <p>Step 3</p>
    <img src="images/paper_decorations_3.jpg" height="500px" width="500px">
    <p>Using a needle and thread sew the middle fold together. 
        Then adhere the ends together with a glue stick.</p>

    <p>Step 4</p>
    <img src="images/paper_decorations_4.jpg" height="500px" width="500px">
    <p>Sew a second piece of thread and tie in a knot to create 
        a loop. Use this to hang the decoration wherever you like!</p>
