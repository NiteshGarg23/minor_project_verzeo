    <h3>Terms of Service and Privacy Policies</h3>

    <div class="terms">

        <p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your 
            access to and use of the DIYs Made Easy website, 
            apps, APIs and widgets (“DIYs Made Easy” or the “Service”). 
            Please read these Terms carefully and contact us if you 
            have any questions. By accessing or using DIYs Made Easy, 
            you agree to be bound by these Terms, our Privacy Policy, 
            our Cookies Policy and our Community Guidelines.</p>

        <p>DIYs Made Easy helps you discover and do what you love. 
            To do that, we show you things we think will be relevant, 
            interesting and personal to you based on your onsite and 
            offsite activity. To provide our Service, we need to be 
            able to identify you and your interests. Some of the things
            we show you are promoted by advertisers. As part of our service, 
            we try to ensure that even promoted content is relevant and 
            interesting to you. You can identify promoted content because 
            it will be clearly labelled.</p>

        <p>We value hearing from our users, and are always interested in 
            learning about ways we can make DIYs Made Easy better. If you choose 
            to submit comments, ideas or feedback, you agree that we are 
            free to use them without any restriction or compensation to you. 
            By accepting your submission, Pinterest doesn’t waive any rights 
            to use similar or related feedback previously known to DIYs Made Easy, 
            or developed by its employees, or obtained from sources other than you.</p>

        <p>If you use DIYs Made Easy for commercial purposes (i.e. you are not a consumer) 
            without agreeing to our Business Terms as required by Section 2(c) of 
            these Terms, you agree to indemnify and hold harmless 
            DIYs Made Easyt Inc, DIYs Made Easy Europe Ltd, their affiliates and their 
            respective officers, directors, employees and agents from and against 
            any claims, suits, proceedings, disputes, demands, liabilities, damages, 
            losses, costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable legal 
            and accounting fees (including costs of defence of claims, suits or proceedings 
            brought by third parties), in any way related to your access to or use of our 
            Service, your User Content or your breach of any of these Terms.</p>
